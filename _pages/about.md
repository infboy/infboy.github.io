I am a doctoral student majoring in Computer Science. Currently, I am enrolled at Henan University, where my master's advisor was Professor Xianyu Zuo and my doctoral advisor is Professor Lei Zhang. My research interests primarily focus on unsupervised feature selection, clustering, and privacy computing.

**Throughout my academic career, I have participated in several projects, including but not limited to:**

**[1]. National Civil Space Infrastructure Common Technology Support Project**: This project is a key support project of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, aimed at addressing the common application support needs of nine land observation satellites launched during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan period and beyond, improving the quantitative application level of remote sensing satellites, establishing a national civil space infrastructure common application support platform, and creating a comprehensive service platform for collecting six types of ground truth data.

**[2]. High-resolution Earth System Scientific Research Demonstration Project**: This is a national major special project where Henan University is mainly responsible for three sub-system modules: "Demonstration Subsystem for the Response of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to Climate Change," "Demonstration Subsystem for Ecosystem Changes in the Loess Plateau," and "Demonstration Subsystem for Disaster Emergency Monitoring in Tibet.

**[3]. Hainan Dianan Smart Internet Management Service Platform**: This project was commissioned by Henan Yunsihui Education Technology Co., Ltd. to Henan University for the development of an intelligent English online learning system. Based on the assessment of students' vocabulary and problem-solving abilities, it dynamically adjusts students' learning levels through a learning ability model, thereby accurately grasping students' learning situations and pushing corresponding learning content.

**[4]. Optimization Study of Train Operation Schedules Based on Passenger Demand for Urban Rail Transit Services**: This project was commissioned by Casco Signal (Zhengzhou) Co., Ltd. to Henan University for research on train operation schedules. By studying the characteristics of urban rail transit passenger flow changes, modeling and analyzing large amounts of historical passenger flow data and concurrent scheduling arrangements, it aims to achieve optimal capacity matching with passenger flow under resource and constraint conditions, i.e., the optimal train schedule.

**[5]. Construction and Application of Adaptive Sparse Learning Models for High-dimensional Data**: This project focuses on high-dimensional adaptive structural sparse feature selection models derived from high-dimensional data analysis in face recognition and biomedicine. Its significance lies in effectively addressing the analysis problems of large-scale high-dimensional data with correlated feature structures in practical applications, providing a rich theoretical foundation for high-dimensional feature selection, and having important application value in areas such as face recognition, gene selection, cancer treatment, and diagnosis.
